# SQL for Data Science

I created this repository to post all the Quiz codes from the course "SQL for Data Science" that I did through Coursera - University of California, Davis.

#### Week 1

- Distinguish between use of SQL for data science applications and SQL for more common data management operations.
- Use an Entity Relationship diagram, describing the data elements, their relationships, and inter-dependencies and determine if the existent data is sufficient to address a business question.
- Retrieve one or more columns of data from a table that relates to the research topic.
- Identify a subset of data needed from a column or set of columns and write a SQL query to limit to those results.
- Create an analysis environment and use INSERT to put data into a table.
- Add effective comments in your queries so that one, you can remember what you're doing, and two, so others can review your work.

#### Week 2

- Compare analytics tool and CPU time performance between a filtered and unfiltered dataset.
- Given a dataset analysis requirement, use WHERE, IN, NOT, AND, and OR alone or in combination to filter the dataset.
- Determine whether or not to use wildcards in a data filter or search situation.
- Use wildcards to search or filter data based on requirements. Use regular expressions for text processing
- Use ORDER BY to sort data according to requirements for number of columns in the sort, sort direction, and sort position.
- Create common math operation calculated fields and aliases for calculated fields.
- Use AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM to profile data.
- Summarize data according to one or more criterion using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

#### Week 3

- Retrieve data from multiple tables using subqueries.
- Join tables using an Inner Join and table aliases.
- Filter a given data set using set theory by joining tables using Natural, Outer, and Self Joins.
- Assess the risk versus benefit of using a Cross Join or Cartesian Join on a set of data.
- Create an analysis table from multiple queries using the UNION operator.

#### Week 4

- Manipulate strings, dates, and numeric data using functions to integrate data from different sources into fields with the correct format for analysis.
- Use Case / When statements to recode a set of data for grouping at a different level (e.g. cities to regions).
- Use Views to simplify SQL operations
- Identify organizational, governance, business, and data conditions that indicate use of a join to prepare data for analysis.
- Recite and implement the 3 rules for changing an analysis question into a sql statement
